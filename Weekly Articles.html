	<p>A decade ago, bell bottom jeans, round sunglasses, and denim jackets would have made you look like the weird kid that nobody would wanna hang around with.</p>

(insert Adam Sandler Gif)


	<p>But now, If you were to wear all of these at once in public, people your own age would actually admire you for your uniqueness and probably break down your door just to ask where you got such stylish clothes. Just like fashion, music is starting to take a lot of inspiration from  70’s based influences. A lot of current surfer rock, garage rock, and many other types of alternative music are starting to get quite reminiscent of something you would hear back when Jimi Hendrix was burning guitars on stage. 

	It makes sense that this style is making a big come back because it seems like ever since the 90’s, music has been taking influences in the reverse direction. The 90’s took inspiration from the 80’s, Rock kinda dropped off in the 2000’s, and In recent years, rock music is being made in the styles of 70’s hard rock. </p>

(insert Foxygen - We Are The 21st Century Ambassadors of Peace And Magic)

	<p>This track was released as late as 2013 on their album with the same name. Its outstanding to see the progressive, psychedelic style on this song being replicated as close as possible to music from the time. A good mix of The Rolling Stones and The Doors is the only thing i can think of when I'm listening to this. </p>

(insert Greta Van Fleet - Highway Tune comparison to Led Zeppelin - When the Levee Breaks) 

	<p>This band is actually brand new. 2017 dates this little ditty from Greta Van Fleet who might as well be a Led Zeppelin cover band for they sound identical. Im willing to bet the average person wouldn't be able to tell the difference by the sound alone. 

	Now while this stuff sounds like something right out of the era, its noticeable to see the influences on new rock music that the 70’s had.</p>

(insert Death From Above 1975 - Trainwreck 1975) 

	<p>While this may sound like a different style at first listen, it seems that with more and more playtime, the old fashioned influence can be heard. The rhythmic piano beat on the chorus with the clear tambourine accents makes this song quite unique. This brings me to my next band.</p>

(insert Wolfmother - White Unicorn)

	<p>Wolfmother can be called with all confidence one of the last progressive rock bands ever. The heavy influences from bands like The Who and Deep Purple are apparent on this track in particular. Rolling drum fills and amazing vocal performances leaves this band in a 4 album History of originality. 

	And while it may seem that these are the only few new rock bands that keep the genre kicking, there are actually plenty, plenty more. If you are interested in new rock music, you should check out the current California rock scene. Lots of new age Surfer rock and Garage rock is being uploaded here and there everyday and it needs more recognition.</p>
